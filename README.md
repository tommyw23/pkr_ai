# pkr_ai_test — Screenshot demo

This small project shows how to take a full-screen screenshot with Python using `pyautogui` and save it with a timestamped filename.

Files created:

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open a PowerShell terminal in this folder (or open the folder in VS Code).

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:

```powershell
python capture.py
```

You should see output like:

```
Saved: screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png
```

The screenshot file will appear in this folder.
